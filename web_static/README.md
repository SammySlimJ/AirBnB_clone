# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Project Overview
This project is the front-end design and prototyping of the AirBnB clone application. It focuses on creating simple static HTML pages and styling them using CSS to create the look and feel of the application. The objective is to learn and practice HTML and CSS without involving any JavaScript or dynamic content. 

The pages will include fake content and static styling to lay the foundation for the future integration of dynamic data and backend functionality.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

- `images/`: Contains image files used within the project (e.g., logos, icons, etc.).
- `styles/`: Contains all CSS files for styling the HTML pages.
- `README.md`: This file with project overview and instructions.
- `0-index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the starting page of the AirBnB clone.

## Requirements

1. **HTML**:
   - Write clean and well-structured HTML markup.
   - Follow the W3C standards for HTML to ensure validity.
   - Ensure that HTML files are structured in a way that can be easily styled with CSS.

2. **CSS**:
   - All styles should be in the `styles/` folder.
   - No use of `!important` in CSS.
   - No use of `id` selectors (e.g., `#id`).
   - Use of semantic HTML tags and proper CSS properties to style the pages.
   - Images should be placed in the `images/` folder.

3. **General Guidelines**:
   - No JavaScript will be used at this stage.
   - No dynamic content or external data.
   - Focus on building the structure with HTML and applying styling with CSS.
   - Your project should validate with the W3C validator for both HTML and CSS.

4. **File Structure**:
   - The HTML files should be structured with proper indentation, and all files should end with a newline.
